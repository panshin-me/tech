### Know Bugs

**found by me and another users.**
  
- Magnifier doesnâ€™t seen to be working
  
- Memory out when grabbing more than 10X10 screens.

### TODO:

**what in next version.**
  
- grab large size maps
  
- The GPSTuner have auto map loading feature. We can use maps with different resolution, and different level of information on map. That provide option in time of zoom out or zoom in, change maps automatically. So I want to add feature - grabbing maps with some levels of zoom.
