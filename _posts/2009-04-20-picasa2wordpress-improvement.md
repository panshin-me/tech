I organize my personal photo library by Picasa from Google. And I would like to post full albums with photos with a little amount of buttons presses to my WordPress based blog, but I didn't find something suitable for me from huge count of plugins for WordPress.
<!--more--> Whatever I found a script "[Picasa2Wordpress](http://clyang.net/blog/2009/02/06/128)" that use [Picasa Button API](http://code.google.com/apis/picasa/docs/button_api.html) and it's what I really need. But it wasn't enough for me. I was need to post post in additional to upload photos, so I Improve the script.
