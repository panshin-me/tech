I like my Suzuki Splash. The car has lot of advantages, like fuel consumption, big back seats space. However my model does not have AUX socket.
<!--more-->

First of all, I checked with local car service, and found that install AUX is pricey: 600 NIS Â± $ 173.81.
  
So, I checked how can I make it by myself. I found Connect2 CTVSZX001 AUX adapter on eBay.

The version is suitable for Panasonic PACR01, PACR02, PACR03, PACR04, PACR05, PACR06, PACR07, PACR08 head-unit (you can found the version on the front panel of your head-unit).
  
Mine is PACR08.

The package included:
   
- CTVSZX001 Adapter
   
- Installation guide
   
- Head Unit cable
   
- 2x RCA to 3.5mm plug adapter

The installation guide did not help me at all, I found in internet all information, how to install the adapter.
  
From instructions that I found, I understood that it is complicated to remove head unit. However there is another way to access to the back connector of head unit.

The easiest way to access to back connector is from the left side of head unit.
  
There is two variation how to access to back connector, the variations is according to your car wheel side. For right side wheel (UK models like cars) you should remove gloves box, and for left side wheel, you should remove panel under your wheel.

Removing gloves box (right side wheel):
  
Open gloves box and press in the sides of the glove box. There are two tabs behind the dashboard that hold it in place so you need to push the glove box sides in far enough for these tabs to clear the edge of the dash.

Once you have released the tabs and lowered the front of the glove box, pull it towards you to release the hinges which just clip on.

Removing panel (left side wheel)
  
The panel under the wheel is hold by clips, so you should just pull the panel towards you and the panel will be released.

Connecting adaptor:
  
As you can see on back head unit, on previous photo, there is white connector between the aerial plug and the main power&speaker plugs. This the plug that adaptor should be connected to. You can adjust the position of the plug according to photo and easily to fit and just clicks into place.

The adaptor box itself you can put under the head unit, there is free space.

For now I have one another problem, when I connect my iPhone to the adaptor and in same time charge it from lighter, I have ground loop noise, so I found on eBay Car RCA Amplifier Audio Noise Filter Ground Loop Isolator Suppressor.

In addition, I have Belkin bluetooth music receiver that I don't use at home, so I hope it will fit well as bluetooth adaptor for my car.

There is just one problem with the receiver, to find a cable to connect it to lighter plug. No one provide specification of the plug that suitable for the receiver. However I found on eBay the cable: USB Charging Cable to 2.5&#215;0.7mm DC Tip Plug Connector, and it suit for the receiver very well.
